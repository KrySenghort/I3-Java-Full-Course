==> Access Modifiers
1. public  : The access level of a public modifiers is everywhere.
2. private : The access level of a private modifiers is only within the class. It cannot be accessed from the outside class.
3. default : The access level of a default modifier is only within the package. If we don’t specify any access level, it will be 
   defaulted.
4. protected : The access level of a protected modifiers is only within the package and outside the package through child class or 
   subclass.

==> Non-access Modifiers
1. Sychronized : Controls thread access to a block/method. We used it to protected the exchange of output if we have executed more time. 
2. Transcient : The member is skipped when serializing an object.  
3. Volatile : The variable value always read from the main memory, not from a specific thread memory.
4. Static : The member belongs to the class, not the object of that class. We used it to call and used the variable or method 
   without create object.
5. Final : Value can’t be changed once assigned, methods can’t be overridden and classes can’t be inherited.
6. Abstract : If we applied to a method, It has to be implemented in a subclass and if applied to a class must contains abstract 
   methods. It mean that we create the variable or methods in parent class but we execute on the child class that inherit from 
   parent class.
